## "We must design for the way people behave, not for how we would wish them to behave" --Donald A. Norman

### HCI, Its an University course. There are also a project for this course. Where we build "Gesture Based Motion Controlled Wheel Chair for Disabled People"

The aim of our project is to provide the physically disabled patients who had suffered from losing their extremities due to the accident, age or disease, with an easily controllable wheelchair. Those patients cannot use the manual wheelchair or electric wheelchair with joysticks due to their handicap. The movements of this wheelchair are controlled by automated sensor-based head motion and collision control. The microcontroller is also used and it is programmed to make the wheelchair moves according to the corresponding motion from the patientâ€™s head. Forward movement of the wheelchair due to tilting head forward, left tilt of the user's head will cause the wheelchair to move to the left and so on. An obstacle detection system is done by using accelerometer sensors. This system showed very good result sit will make the usage of this wheelchair safer as compared to standard ones. It will help in enhancing the quality of life for such people and make them less dependent on others. This wheelchair is low cost, provide ease of use and comfortable for the physically disabled patients.
